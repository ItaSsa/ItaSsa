### About me
---

I'm a Data professional that start working with Data Modeling and SQL in 2005. In 2010, I've started working with Business Intelligence, Data Visualization and ETL and helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
After spending all this years working using different technologies in several business contexts, now I'm exploring Data Engineering projects that involving data ingestion in a cloud computing environment.
I love to learn new concepts and technologies, and experiment them, as you will see here.
Being not affraid of challenges and having ability to adapt on new enviroments, I have had a great time as an IT professional. With hard working, but without losing my good hummor. ðŸ¤“
